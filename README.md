# radar-target-detection



In a README file, write brief explanations for the following:

- Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process.
- Selection of Training, Guard cells and offset.
- Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges.



The sweep time can be computed based on the time needed for the signal to travel the unambiguous maximum range.
In general, for an FMCW radar system, the sweep time should be at least 5 to 6 times the round trip time. This example uses a factor of 5.5.
